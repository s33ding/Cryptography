# CRYPTOGRAPHY

This repository was created to provide a solution for encrypting passwords and making them accessible to scripts, while also handling sensitive data from other individuals in a secure manner. After conducting research, it was found that existing tools were not sufficient to meet the necessary requirements, thus custom code was developed to better address these needs.

### In this repository I used some stand methods such as:

- Fernet: famous algorithm for symmetric encryption and authentication to data.
- GnuPrivacy Guard (GPG): allows you to securely encrypt files so that only the intended recipient can decrypt them. Specifically, GPG complies with the OpenPGP standard. It is modeled on a program called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP). PGP was written in 1991 by Phil Zimmerman.

### Some importante Python libs that  I used in this repository:

- Cryptography
- Pandas
- Mysql
- Json
- Pickle
- Sys
- Os
